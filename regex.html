      Regexp/ regular expressions, is not easy thing to learn. And to be honest, most web devs dont know very much Regexp - just coz it can be so confusing. It can alse be very precise n useful. What a regular exps is, is a way define a pattern n seek out matches based on this specific pattern. You can search, search n replace n test ur Regexp. and no, they arent regular at all.

      Defining a new Regexp
      Like how we defined a new array or new Date();
      we use the same typed of decalaration.

      var myregex = new RegExp(pattern,modifiers);

      often see this written differently.. more like this:

      // var myregex = /pattern/modifiers;

      a modifiers is a spesific rule the pattern should stick to. Like being case-sensitive or to be global. Modifiers can also be called "flags".
      */
      // var myregex = new RegExp(pattern,modifiers);
      // var myregex = /pattern/modifiers;

      /*
        [abc] ==> this will be find any chars between the brackets. So it'll look for a,b, or c.

        [^xyz] ==> this will find any character NOT in the brackets. So it'll look for the whole alphabet untill the letter x.

        [0-9] this will find any number from 0-9

        [A-Z] this will find any letter in the alphabet that is uppercase.

        [a-z] this will find any letter in the alphabet that is lowercase.

        [A-z] a mix of the 2 above this. Finds anything from a capital A to lowercase z.

        (box|floor|bed|desk) finds any of the 4 words. The | means OR (Like how || means OR).

        yourWord ==>will look for "yourWord" excactly. case Sensitive!

        Quantifier is how many occurences or where the pattern starts or end, basically.

        g* ==> Matchesa string that has zero or more occurences of g

        t? ==> Matches a string that has zero or one occurences of t. Doesnt stop at 1 like * does.

        z+ ==> Matches a string that has at least one z. So, one or more.

        a{X,} ==> Matches any string that has "a" at least X amount of times in a row.

        b{X,Y} ==> Matches any string that has "b" at least X to Y amount of times. ie b{2,3} matches "bb" and "bbb"

        c{X} Matches any string that has X amount of occurences in a row.

        ^w ==> Matches a string that starts with "w"

        q$ ==> Matches a string that ends with "q"

      A metacharacter is a character that has a special meaning n is not used in its literal way \w looks for a word.
      w is a letter.

      . ==> Looks for a single character except for newlines
      \w ==> Looks for a word character
      \W ==> Looks for a non-word character
      \d ==> Looks for a digit
      \D ==> Looks for a non-digit character
      \s ==> Looks for a whitespace character
      \S ==> Looks for a non-whitespace character
      \b ==> Looks for a match at the beginning/end of a word

      \B ==> Looks for a match not at the beginning/end of a word
      \0 ==> Looks for a NULL character
      \n ==> Looks for a new line character
      \f ==> Looks for a form feed character
      \r ==> Looks for a carriage return character
      \t ==> Looks for a tab character

        Modifiers are how we modify our pattern.

        i = case Insensitive. Or .. "Ignore-case".
        g = global. It will find all matches and not stop at just one.
        we add a modifier at the end of a pattern.

        if u want to test if ur RegExp works, u can do what the example above has been doing. They use the .test() method.

        yourRegex.test("your string here");

        .test() will give u "true" or "false" answers. True if there is at least one match. False if there is no match.


        replace()
        if u want to replace a pattern with string, u can use the .replace() object.

        string.replace("string or Regex","replacement");

        we can also get all the matches into an array by use the .match() method.

      There are thousands of different patterns u can make with all of these. This topic to spring hundreds of questions as well. I ask, b4 u ask ur question, google ur question first.

I dont usually request this - this is, however, a very lengthy and questionable topic with tonnes of QnA;s on the net.
