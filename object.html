        You've heard the term "object" often n how to use objects like .length and methos that are used on objects, such as new Date().getDay();. Now we'll learn how to create our own objects. objects, when created, are very similiar in nature to array - where they both hold multiple values and can hold other objects.

      //first, the code.
      var wallet = {
        cards:{
          visa: 1,
          mastercard:1,
          amex:0,
          debit:1
        },
        cash:{
          Canadian:1500,
          American:2200.50,
          Euros:"No Use"
        },
        id: "yes"
      }

      alert(wallet.id);

      /*
        our object will start with a curly bracket and end in a curly bracket inside of a variable every single time.
        Inside our object, we leave 3 vales.
        1. the object name, IE: id from above.
        2. the object name value. IE: "yes" from id:
        3. Another object that repeatss #1 n #2.

        here's what it looks like:
          objectNameA : value,
        objectNameB:{
                  objectNameB1:vaue1,
                  objectNameB2:vaue2,
                }

        after every object value, we use a comma to prepare for the next object name/ object value. If a value is the last object in your list, do not use a comma.

        after every name, use a full colin.
        Strings need quotes, numbers do not.
      */
      //CALLING AN OBJECT
      // this is very easy. just look down the tree we made above. Those are just like using variables. ie:
        // mywallet.cash.Canadian = 1500,
      // is the same as
        //  mywallet['cash']['Canadian'] = 1500;

      /*
        Now u know about arrays, had some practise with objects n method attached to them u can now write ur own objects.
